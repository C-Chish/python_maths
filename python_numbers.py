# Basic-Arithmetic-Operators
# Shortcut for remembering quick operators

# Arithmetic Operators:
# Addition:       3 + 2
# Substraction:   3 - 2
# Multiplication: 3 * 2
# Division:       3 / 2     -Does not drop decimal
# Floor Division: 3 // 2    -Drops decimal
# Exponent:       3 ** 2    -To the power of
# Modulus         3 % 2     -Gives remainder after a division
# No remainders=  Number is even
# Remainders = Number is uneven

# Order of operation, used with parenthesis. eg:
# print(3 * 2 + 1)
# print(3 * (2 + 1))

# num = 2
# num *= 10
# print(num)

# ABS (abs)- absolute value "the magnitude of a real number without
# regard to its sign."
# print(abs(-3))

# Round- rounding numbers to the nearest interger value
# print(round(1.23)) = 1
# Rounding digits to the first decimal
# print(round(1.266, 1)) = 1.3

# Comparisons Operators
