# Write “Hello Leslie” to the command line in python.
print("Hello Leslie")

# Create two integer variables (call them whatever you like)
# add them together and print the two numbers and
# the result on the command line in the following format “Number 1
# is <n1> and number 2 is <n2>. Added together they make <n3>!”

# num_1 = 1
# num_2 = 2
# result = 1 + 2
# numbers_added = f'number 1 is {num_1}, Number 2 is {num_2}, \
# added together they make {result}!'
# print(numbers_added)

# Create integer, floating point, string and boolean variables and print the name
# and type to the command line. Hint, use the
# built-in functin type() to print the type of the variable.


# Create an array with numbers from 0-9.
# my_array = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# Write a for loop that prints the numbers from 0-9.
# for item in my_array:
#     print(item)
# Write a while loop that prints the numbers from 0-9.

# Create an array with numbers from 0-9,
# multiply each element by 2 and print it out.

# multiplied = []

# Print the first 5 elements and last 5 elements of the array from 0-9.
# my_array = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
